# Simple A/B testing for linguistic experiments

In online experiments we often want to dispatch particpants randomly to different versions of the test/questionnaire. It is quite simple to do this using a start webpage with a tiny bit of javascript.

A free and simple way to make and host the website is with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It only takes a few minutes.

- Make a GitHub account on https://github.com
- Follow the instructions for making a GitHub Pages website on https://pages.github.com/
- Copy and customise the html code from the [index.html](./index.html) file in this repository to the index.html file you created in your new repository

If my username is **evolang** and my repository is called **sample-ab-test**, then the repository url will be https://github.com/evoling/sample-ab-test/ and the automatically generated webpage will be https://evoling.github.io/sample-ab-test/.

The links in your html code could be e.g. two different versions of a Google Forms questionnaire.
